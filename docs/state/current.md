# RFDGameStudio — Project State

*Last updated: July 19 2026*

## Mediation Resolution Fix — COMPLETED

### Motivation — Same Bug Class as Exploration (Never Resolved)

`launch_mediation` set `state.active_mediation = {..., cycles_remaining=1,
status="active"}` and returned. Confirmed via grep — `active_mediation`
appeared exactly once in the entire file, only in the launch function.
No resolution, no cleanup, no role release. Slimes assigned to mediation
were soft-locked indefinitely with no path back. This is the same bug
class as the Exploration resolution fix: a launch function with no
corresponding resolution in `advance_cycle`.

### What Was Built

Ported exactly from `resolveMediation` in the real source
(`intake/slimegarden/extracted/src/gameLogic.ts` ~line 898):

- **Mediation resolution block** added to `advance_cycle`, placed
  alongside the existing Exploration resolution block.
- **Party power** = sum of `chm` across all party members.
- **Target power** = `40 + (strength > 0 ? round((1-strength)*60) : 35)`
  — distinct from Exploration's `40 + round(strength*60)`.
- **Success chance**: same shape as Exploration — `ratio > 1 →
  0.85 + (ratio-1)*0.1`, else `0.2 + ratio*0.6`, clamped `[0.15, 0.98]`.
- **On success**: `stabilityChange = floor(15 + totalChm/6 + random()*8)`.
- **On failure — key difference from Exploration**:
  `stabilityChange = floor(5 + random()*5)` — still a real, positive
  increase. Mediation never produces zero progress, unlike Exploration's
  clean binary success/fail.
- **Empty-party guard**: distinct third outcome — aborts immediately
  with no stability change at all.
- **Node strength** unit: confirmed 0-1 scale throughout the codebase
  (`math.min(1.0, strength + 0.02)`, `strength * 100`, etc.).
  `stabilityChange` is in percentage points (5-42), so `/100` conversion
  is correct.
- **Party release**: all three outcomes (success, failure, empty-party
  abort) set `locked_role = nil` and clear `state.active_mediation`.

### Test Anchors (10 new, all passing)

| Test | Target |
|---|---|
| `test_mediation_party_power_sums_chm` | Real party, hand-computed sum |
| `test_mediation_success_chance_above_ratio_one` | ratio > 1 formula match |
| `test_mediation_success_chance_below_ratio_one` | ratio < 1 formula match |
| `test_mediation_chance_clamped_to_bounds` | Extreme ratios within [0.15, 0.98] |
| `test_mediation_success_increases_node_strength` | Seeded-RNG forced-success case |
| `test_mediation_failure_still_increases_strength` | **Key distinction** — failure still positive |
| `test_mediation_empty_party_aborts_no_change` | Distinct third outcome, no change |
| `test_mediation_slimes_always_released` | All three outcomes release party |
| `test_mediation_state_cleared_after_resolution` | `active_mediation` is nil after |
| `test_full_mediation_lifecycle` | Launch → resolve → end-to-end state change |

### Final Floor

- **Python: 432 passed** (was 422, +10 new mediation tests)

## Color-Stat Data Deduplication — COMPLETED

### Motivation — Triplication Found Immediately After Original Directive Shipped

The "Real Color + Shape Stat Computation" directive (above) introduced
color stat data in **three** places: `cultures`/`neutral_traits.gray`
in `data.yaml` (pre-existing), a new `color_specs` key in `data.yaml`
(dead — nothing read it), and a hardcoded `COLOR_STAT_SPECS` table in
`logic.lua` (the only one actually used). The `color_specs` key was a
straight duplicate of `cultures`/`neutral_traits.gray`; the Lua table
was a triplicate. This refactor eliminates both redundant copies,
making `cultures`/`neutral_traits.gray` the single source of truth,
passed as an explicit `color_specs` parameter — the same pattern as
`color_targets`/`shape_targets`.

### What Changed

- **Removed** `color_specs` key from `data.yaml` (dead, never read).
- **Removed** `COLOR_STAT_SPECS` hardcoded table from `logic.lua`.
- **`get_interpolated_specs(hue, saturation, color_specs)`** — now
  takes `color_specs` as a parameter, reads `color_specs[a1.color]` /
  `color_specs.Gray` instead of the removed local table.
- **`calculate_stats(color, level, hue, saturation, vertex_count,
  irregularity, color_specs)`** — threads `color_specs` through to
  `get_interpolated_specs`.
- **`create_seed_slime(color, pattern, color_specs)`** — gains
  `color_specs` param; falls back to flat baseline if nil (for
  `advance_cycle` callers that don't pass it).
- **`initiate_breeding(..., color_specs)`** — gains `color_specs` as
  9th parameter, threaded to `calculate_stats`.
- **`advance_cycle(state, color_specs)`** — gains optional
  `color_specs` param for stray detection's `create_seed_slime` call.
- **TS `App.tsx`** — `buildColorSpecs()` helper constructs the dict
  from `cultures` + `neutral_traits.gray` at call time; passed to
  both `initiate_breeding` and `advance_cycle`.
- **All Python tests** updated to build and pass `color_specs` from
  real `cultures`/`neutral_traits.gray` data.

### What Did NOT Change

- Stat math (`get_shape_stat_modifiers`, `calculate_stats` formula) —
  untouched, verified correct.
- `color_targets`/`shape_targets` wiring — reference pattern only.
- No UI changes — pure data-flow correction.

### Test Anchors (3 new dedup verification tests)

| Test | Target |
|---|---|
| `test_color_specs_removed_from_data_yaml` | Dead key confirmed gone |
| `test_no_hardcoded_color_stat_specs_in_lua` | `COLOR_STAT_SPECS` confirmed removed |
| `test_get_interpolated_specs_with_real_cultures_data` | Same values from real source |

### Final Floor

- **Python: 422 passed** (was 419, +3 dedup verification tests)

## Real Color + Shape Stat Computation — COMPLETED

### Motivation — Stats Were Flat or Absent

`stats` existed in exactly one place in `logic.lua` — `create_seed_slime`,
as a flat, identical baseline (`hp=100, atk=10, def=10, agi=10, int=10,
chm=10`) for every color. `breed_slimes`'s returned child had **no
`stats` field at all**. No genetics-based stat variation existed anywhere.

### What Was Built

Ported exactly from the real source
(`intake/slimegarden/extracted/src/gameLogic.ts`):

- **`color_specs`** added to `data.yaml` — 7 color entries (Red, Orange,
  Yellow, Green, Purple, Blue, Gray), each with `base_stats` and `growth`
  (6 stats per entry), matching `COLOR_SPECS` exactly.
- **`COLOR_STAT_SPECS`** + **`SEED_SHAPE_DEFAULTS`** lookup tables in
  `logic.lua` (self-contained, no caller signature changes needed).
- **`get_interpolated_specs(hue, saturation)`** — finds the two adjacent
  color anchors the hue falls between, linearly interpolates `base_stats`
  and `growth` by sector position, then blends toward Gray by
  `saturation/100`. Mirrors Color's existing hue/saturation breeding math.
- **`get_shape_stat_modifiers(vertex_count, irregularity)`** — weighted
  linear ramps (not step functions), each capped at 10% multiplicative
  bonus. Simple/stable shapes → +HP/+DEF, clean/complex → +INT/+CHM,
  jagged → +ATK/+AGI.
- **`calculate_stats(color, level, hue, saturation, vertex_count,
  irregularity)`** — combines interpolated color specs + level growth +
  shape modifiers. Pattern switch deliberately NOT ported (retired
  discrete Pattern system; SlimeWorld uses Accent now).

### Critical Sequencing Finding

`calculate_stats` is called in **`initiate_breeding`**, not
`breed_slimes`. The real pipeline order is:

1. `breed_slimes` → returns child with hue/saturation/color but **no
   vertex_count/irregularity**
2. `breed_shape` → returns shape, then `child.vertex_count`/
   `child.irregularity` are set
3. `breed_accent` → uses child's shape genetics
4. **`calculate_stats`** → called after all breed steps, using child's
   final hue/saturation/vertex_count/irregularity

If `calculate_stats` had been placed in `breed_slimes`, shape genetics
would silently never affect stats — the code would look correct, color
tests would pass, but shape would be invisible. Verified against the real
call order at `logic.lua:495-522`.

### Wiring

- **`create_seed_slime`** — replaced flat baseline with
  `calculate_stats(color, 1, hue, saturation, seed_shape.vertex_count,
  seed_shape.irregularity)` using `SEED_SHAPE_DEFAULTS[color]`.
- **`initiate_breeding`** — added `child.stats = calculate_stats(...)`
  after `breed_shape` sets `child.vertex_count`/`child.irregularity` and
  before `table.insert`.

### Test Anchors (10 new, all passing)

| Test | Target |
|---|---|
| `test_get_interpolated_specs_pure_color_matches_color_specs` | hue=0, sat=100 → Red's exact base_stats |
| `test_get_interpolated_specs_midpoint_blend` | hue=30 → midpoint of Red/Orange |
| `test_get_interpolated_specs_zero_saturation_is_gray` | sat=0 → Gray's base_stats |
| `test_get_shape_stat_modifiers_simple_stable_boosts_hp_def` | Low vertex/irr → +HP/+DEF |
| `test_get_shape_stat_modifiers_jagged_boosts_atk_agi` | High irr → +ATK/+AGI |
| `test_calculate_stats_level_scaling` | Level 1 vs 5 → growth-driven difference |
| `test_create_seed_slime_stats_vary_by_color` | Red vs Blue seed → different stats |
| `test_breed_slimes_produces_real_stats_field` | Bred child has non-empty stats |
| `test_shape_genetics_actually_affects_bred_stats` | Different shapes → different stats |
| `test_pattern_switch_not_ported` | No Pattern names in calculate_stats |

### Final Floor

- **Python: 419 passed** (was 409, +10 new tests)
- **TypeScript: 146 passed / 21 files** (unchanged — Lua/data-layer only)

### Deliberately Deferred

- **Accent-based stat contribution** — real, separate, undecided future
  design work. Whether Accent (`diffusion_ratio`/`amplitude`) should get
  its own stat contribution is not decided here.
- **Stat tuning** — ported exact values; playtesting may warrant
  rebalancing base_stats, growth rates, or the 10% shape-bonus cap.
- **UI display of stat breakdown** — Lua/data-layer only; no UI changes.

## Multi-Return Truncation Fix — Phase 1 COMPLETED

### Motivation — Studio-Wide Bug

`LuaExecutor.call()` in `ts/src/engine/executor.ts` hardcoded `nresults=1` in
`lua_pcall`, truncating all but the first return value from Lua functions. This
silently lost error strings from the common `return value, error` idiom across
**31 multi-return statements in 6 of 9 games**.

### What was fixed

**`ts/src/engine/executor.ts`** — `call()` now uses `LUA_MULTRET` instead of
`nresults=1`, computes `resultCount = newTop - baseTop` via stack arithmetic,
and returns `unknown[]` with all return values.

**`ts/src/engine/runtime.ts`** — `call()` return type updated to `unknown[]`.

**`ts/src/engine/types.ts`** — `LuaExecutor` interface `call` return type
updated to `unknown[]`.

**`ts/src/games/slimeworld/App.tsx`** — All 16 call sites migrated to
destructure `unknown[]` returns. `luaResult()` helper updated to accept
`unknown[]` directly.

**`ts/src/hooks/useLuaCall.ts`** — Backward-compat fix: extracts `results[0]`
from the `unknown[]` so all hook-based games (chimera_wilds, brewfield,
mutant_battle_ball, slime_coin, horse_racing) get the first return value
without needing App.tsx changes.

**`ts/src/games/scrapcrawl/App.tsx`** — Two direct `executor.call()` sites
given `[0]` extraction (compatibility fix, not full migration).

**Test files updated:** `test_executor.ts`, `test_runtime.ts`, `test_arcade.ts`,
`test_slimeworld_petition_wiring.tsx`, `test_lua_slime_field_safety.tsx` — all
mocks and expectations updated for `unknown[]` return type.

### Stack Arithmetic Proof

`ts/tests/test_multi_return_proof.ts` (5 tests) — throwaway proof using real
fengari executor with synthetic Lua functions:
- `return 1, 2, 3` → `[1, 2, 3]`
- `return nil, "error"` → `[null, "error"]`
- `return 42` → `[42]`
- `return` → `[]`
- `return a+b, a*b, a-b` → `[8, 15, -2]`

### Permanent Detector

**`tools/detect_multi_return/scan_lua.py`** — Scans `games/*/logic.lua` for
multi-value `return` statements. Found 31 multi-return statements across 6
games (slimeworld, horse_racing, mutant_battle_ball, chimera_wilds, brewfield,
shoal).

**`ts/tests/test_multi_return_bridge.ts`** (7 tests) — Permanent regression
test. Calls real Lua functions via fengari executor with error-triggering
arguments, asserts both return values are captured (not truncated):
- `fulfill_petition` error path → `[null, "error string"]`
- `recycle_slime` error path → `[null, "error string"]`
- `can_unlock_slot` insufficient funds → `[false, "Insufficient..."]`
- `can_unlock_slot` max capacity → `[false, "...maximum capacity"]`
- `generate_chimera` error path → `[null, "Missing slot..."]`
- `assemble_mutant` error path → `[null, "Missing part..."]`
- `initiate_breeding` same-parent error → `[null, "Parents must differ"]`

**`tests/test_multi_return_detector.py`** (7 tests) — Python tests for the
scanner: runs without error, finds slimeworld/horse_racing multi-returns, JSON
output valid, detects 6+ games, return value count >= 2, handles nonexistent
game.

### Final Floors
- **Python: 409 passed** (was 402, +7 new detector tests)
- **TypeScript: 146 passed / 21 files** (was 134/19, +12 new tests, +2 new files)

### Phase 2 — DEFERRED (real, not implied)

The remaining 8 non-SlimeWorld games have 20 call sites that still use the
old single-value pattern via `useLuaCall` (which now extracts `[0]` for
backward compat). A full migration of those 20 sites to destructure `unknown[]`
and access error strings is real future work, explicitly deferred. The games
function correctly today because `useLuaCall` returns `results[0]`, but they
cannot access multi-return error strings until migrated.

## Framework Generation Layer, Module 1: Pure-Data Extraction — COMPLETED

### Motivation — Real Regression Prevention

This morning's Color Codex regression: a directive scoped from a grep pattern
(`guild_|rival_`) missed 6 real `arc_triad` and 2 real `skip_triad` entries
sitting in the exact same `COLOR_TARGETS` array in the same source file. A
human reading-comprehension failure, not a data problem. The array was never
ambiguous; a person just didn't read all of it.

**Module 1 prevents this mechanically:** an AST-based classifier walks every
top-level `export const` in a `.ts` file, determines if the initializer is
pure literal data (arrays/objects of only strings, numbers, booleans, nested
literals — no function calls, no external references, no computed keys), and
emits a YAML staging fragment with camelCase→snake_case field conversion
matching the real `data.yaml` convention.

### What was built

**`ts/tools/framework_gen/classify.ts`** — AST-based classifier using the
TypeScript compiler package (already a dependency). Walks top-level exported
`VariableStatement` nodes, recursively checks each initializer for literal
purity. When uncertain, classifies as not-pure-data (bias toward caution).

**`ts/tools/framework_gen/emit_yaml.ts`** — Converts classified pure-data
declarations to YAML. `camelToSnake` handles both camelCase fields
(`centerHues` → `center_hues`) and all-caps constants (`COLOR_TARGETS` →
`color_targets`). Field names verified against real `data.yaml` conventions.

**`ts/tools/framework_gen/report.ts`** — Markdown report matching the studio's
`MANIFEST.md` convention. Every "not converted" entry has a real, specific
reason (function call name, external identifier, computed key) — never a
generic "too complex."

**`ts/tools/framework_gen/cli.ts`** — Entry point. Takes a `.ts` file path,
produces YAML fragments + report in a staging output directory. Never writes
to any existing `data.yaml` or `logic.lua`.

### The Load-Bearing Test

`test_extracts_all_17_entries_not_9` — feeds the real `COLOR_TARGETS` source
array containing all 6 Guild + 3 Rival + 6 Arc Triad + 2 Skip Triad entries,
confirms the output YAML has all 17, not the 9 a narrow grep would have found.
**This is the actual regression, reproduced and proven fixed.**

### Tests

**TypeScript (`ts/tests/test_framework_gen_classify.ts`):** 7 tests
- `test_classifies_color_targets_as_pure_data`
- **`test_extracts_all_17_entries_not_9`** — the actual point of the module
- `test_converts_camelCase_to_snake_case_correctly` — verified against real `data.yaml`
- `test_flags_function_call_as_not_pure_data`
- `test_flags_external_reference_as_not_pure_data`
- `test_report_gives_specific_reason_not_generic`
- `test_never_writes_to_real_data_yaml`

### Final Floors
- **Python: 402 passed** (unchanged)
- **TypeScript: 134 passed / 19 files** (was 127/18, +7 new tests, +1 new file)

### Module Roadmap — For Context

| Module | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — Pure-Data Extraction** | This module. AST-classify + auto-emit YAML for literal data. | **Complete** |
| **2 — Ambiguous Review Report** | Deeper analysis of "not pure data" bucket — richer reasoning, partial-conversion suggestions for human review. | Not yet scoped |
| **3 — Logic Stub Generation** | Function declarations get correctly-signatured Lua stubs with original TS source as translation reference. Hardest, riskiest — deliberately last. | Not yet scoped |

Modules 2 and 3 are explicitly separate, real, not-yet-started future work.
Each ships independently, verified on its own, before the next begins.

## Wanderer Petition Wiring — COMPLETED

### Motivation — Most Complete Instance of the Recurring Bug Class

This is the most complete instance of today's "Lua computes it, TS drops it"
bug class: **every layer was missing** — Lua never spawned petitions, TS had
no state field, no handler called fulfillment, no UI showed them. Ground-up,
not just a dropped field.

**Root cause traced completely:**
1. `create_wanderer_petition(cycle, active_petitions)` existed in Lua, real and
   correct (tier-scaled reward, either-or requirement rolling) — but appeared
   exactly once in the entire file: its own definition. Never called, not even
   from `advance_cycle`.
2. `advance_cycle` already expired petitions but never spawned new ones.
   Petitions could only shrink toward zero.
3. `fulfill_petition(state, petition_id, slime_id)` was real, correct — but
   nothing in `App.tsx` ever called it.
4. `LabState` had zero petition-related fields. `stateToLua` had no `petitions`
   key at all.
5. No UI anywhere displayed a petition.

### Changes

**Lua (`games/slimeworld/logic.lua`):**
- Added petition-spawn block to `advance_cycle`, placed right after the
  petition-expiration block. Deterministic spawn when under
  `WANDERER_REQUEST_MAX` (3) — not probabilistic like Contract's 0.65 chance.
  Rationale: petitions are premium encounters (3x payout multiplier, 5-8 cycle
  expiration), not common arrivals. Always spawn when under cap; throttling can
  be added later without changing the call site.
- `create_wanderer_petition` and `fulfill_petition` logic unchanged — only
  called now.

**TypeScript (`ts/src/games/slimeworld/types.ts`):**
- Added `Petition` interface (id, source, requestedColor, requestedShape,
  payoutMultiplier, reward, expiresCycle).
- Added `petitions: Petition[]` to `LabState`.
- Added `luaPetitionToTs` converter (snake_case → camelCase).
- Added `petitions` round-trip to `stateToLua`.

**App.tsx:**
- `initialState` seeds `petitions: []`.
- `handleAdvanceCycle` parses `petitions` from Lua result via `luaPetitionToTs`.
- New `handleFulfillPetition` handler: calls `fulfill_petition`, updates credits
  and removes fulfilled petition from state.

**EconomyTab.tsx:**
- New "Wanderer Petitions" sub-tab alongside "Corp Contracts" and "Galactic
  Market". Mirrors the Contracts card pattern: shows requested color/shape (or
  "Any" if null), payout, cycles remaining, matching idle specimens, fulfill
  action with confirmation modal.

### Tests

**Python (`tests/test_slimeworld_petition_spawning.py`):** 4 tests
- `test_advance_cycle_spawns_petition_under_cap` — real cycle, petition appears
- `test_advance_cycle_does_not_spawn_over_cap` — at cap (3), no new petition
- `test_advance_cycle_still_expires_petitions` — expiration unregressed
- `test_full_petition_lifecycle` — spawn → fulfill → state changes confirmed

**TypeScript (`ts/tests/test_slimeworld_petition_wiring.tsx`):** 5 tests
- `test_createInitialState_seeds_empty_petitions` — source check
- `test_handleAdvanceCycle_parses_real_petitions` — real Lua-generated petition
- `test_handleFulfillPetition_real_success` — matching slime, payout > 0
- `test_handleFulfillPetition_real_failure` — nonexistent slime, null result
- `test_economytab_renders_real_petitions` — UI source check

### Final Floors
- **Python: 402 passed** (was 398, +4 new tests)
- **TypeScript: 127 passed / 18 files** (was 122/17, +5 new tests, +1 new file)

### Note on TS Executor Limitation — RESOLVED
The TS Lua executor (`executor.ts`) previously used `nresults=1` in `lua_pcall`,
truncating multi-return Lua functions to their first value. This was fixed in
the Multi-Return Truncation Fix (Phase 1) — see above. `fulfill_petition` now
correctly returns `[null, "error string"]` on failure.

## Shared Data Layer + Lua→TS Field Safety Alarm — COMPLETED

### Motivation — Five Recurring Bug Instances

Today, five separate bugs shared the same root shape: **Lua computes and returns
something real and correct, and a hand-maintained TS conversion function's fixed
field list silently drops it.** The confirmed instances:

1. **Worker income** — `advance_cycle` computed worker income in Lua, TS conversion dropped it
2. **Breeding consumption (`consumed_slime_id`)** — `initiate_breeding` set `consumed_slime_id` on the child, `luaSlimeToTs` didn't handle it
3. **Color Codex detection (`matched_target_id`)** — `initiate_breeding` set `matched_target_id`, `luaSlimeToTs` didn't handle it
4. **Shape Codex detection (`matched_shape_target_id`)** — `initiate_breeding` set `matched_shape_target_id`, `luaSlimeToTs` didn't handle it
5. **Exploration resolution** — `advance_cycle` exploration results had fields TS didn't parse

Three of the five were confirmed in `luaSlimeToTs` specifically. The fix is not
another patch — it's a structural change that prevents the sixth instance.

### Part A — Shared Data Layer (`getStaticList`)

**Problem:** `gameLogic.ts` hand-copied `COLOR_TARGETS` (17 entries) and
`SHAPE_TARGETS` (23 entries) from `data.yaml` into TypeScript constants. This
duplicates data and creates drift risk — if `data.yaml` changes, the constants
go stale silently.

**Fix:** Added `getStaticList(session, key)` to `ts/src/engine/runtime.ts` —
reads flat arrays directly from `session.files.data[key]` (the parsed
`data.yaml` loaded once at game start). This is a sibling to the existing
`getSchema(session, entity)`, which unwraps `.fields` for entity schemas;
`getStaticList` skips that unwrapping for flat arrays like `color_targets` and
`shape_targets`.

**Changes:**
- `ts/src/engine/runtime.ts` — added `getStaticList(session, key)` function
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/gameLogic.ts` — removed `COLOR_TARGETS` and `SHAPE_TARGETS` constants and their camelCase interfaces; added `RawColorTarget`/`RawShapeTarget` interfaces matching `data.yaml`'s snake_case field names
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/components/SlimeDexTab.tsx` — migrated to `getStaticList(session, 'color_targets')` / `getStaticList(session, 'shape_targets')`; all field accesses updated from camelCase to snake_case (`center_hues`, `saturation_min`, `saturation_max`, `vertex_count`, `irregularity_min`, `irregularity_max`)
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/components/RosterTab.tsx` — migrated `COLOR_TARGETS.find()` calls to `getStaticList` lookup; added `session` prop
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/App.tsx` — passes `session` to `RosterTab`
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/components/EconomyTab.tsx` — removed unused `COLOR_TARGETS` import
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/components/LabTab.tsx` — removed unused `COLOR_TARGETS` import

### Part B — Field-Drift Alarm System

**Problem:** `luaSlimeToTs` in `types.ts` has a fixed field list. When Lua
returns a new field, it's silently dropped — no error, no warning, no signal.

**Fix:** Exported `SLIME_EXPLICIT_LUA_FIELDS` — the real, already-existing set
of field names that `luaSlimeToTs` explicitly handles — as a named constant.
This is not a duplicate list; it's the same set the function actually uses,
exported so a test can reference it. Then created an alarm test that calls the
**real executor bridge** (not a mock) to run `initiate_breeding` and checks
that every field in the real child object is accounted for in the explicit set.

**This is an alarm, not an automatic fix.** When the test fails in the future,
the correct response is a human decision: either add genuine handling in
`luaSlimeToTs` (with proper type coercion), or add to the allowlist with a
comment explaining why it's intentionally unhandled. Never reflexively add to
the allowlist to silence the alarm.

**`luaSlimeToTs` conversion logic is completely unchanged.** This directive
only exports the field list and adds a test — it does not modify how the
function converts fields.

**`luaNodeToTs` was checked and found already correct** — its field list is
complete and matches what Lua returns for planet nodes. It was not touched.

**Other Lua functions audited:**
- `launch_exploration` — returns simple 5-field object, no custom converter, inline field access. No alarm needed.
- `launch_dispatch` — same pattern. No alarm needed.
- `launch_mediation` — same pattern. No alarm needed.
- `advance_cycle` — returns full state. Slimes within it are parsed via `luaSlimeToTs` (already covered by this alarm). Other fields parsed inline with explicit field access. `luaNodeToTs` checked and complete. No additional alarm needed.

### Test Results

- **Python:** 398 passed
- **TypeScript:** 122 passed / 17 files (was 113/15 pre-flight; +9 new tests across 2 new files)

### New Test Files

- `ts/tests/test_shared_data_layer.tsx` (4 tests): `getStaticList` returns real 17-entry color targets, real 23-entry shape targets, throws on missing key, SlimeDexTab renders from live data
- `ts/tests/test_lua_slime_field_safety.tsx` (5 tests): explicit fields export matches conversion logic, alarm fires on real breeding result (passes today = current state clean), alarm would fail on synthetic new field (proves mechanism works), other Lua functions audited with findings, `luaSlimeToTs` logic unchanged

## SlimeWorld Exploration Tests + Codex Wiring Fix — COMPLETED

### What changed
Two parallel efforts completed:

**Part A — Exploration Resolution Tests (Python):**
Created `tests/test_slimeworld_exploration_resolution.py` with 10 test anchors covering the exploration resolution block in `advance_cycle`:
- Scout power = sum of int + agi across party members
- Success chance formula with ratio > 1 and ratio < 1 paths
- Chance clamped to [0.15, 0.98] for extreme ratios
- Node discovery on success (seeded RNG iteration)
- XP awards: 45 on success, 20 on failure (both outcomes verified)
- Scouts return to idle role regardless of outcome
- `active_exploration` cleared to nil after resolution
- Edge case: missing target node — no crash, fail-path XP
- Edge case: empty party — no crash, no XP awarded, log still created

**Part B — Codex Wiring Fix (TypeScript):**
Fixed the recurring "Lua computes it, TS drops it" bug class. Lua's `initiate_breeding` sets `matched_target_id`, `matched_shape_target_id`, and `consumed_slime_id` on the child slime, but `luaSlimeToTs` was silently dropping all three fields. Changes:
- `types.ts`: Added `matchedTargetId`, `matchedShapeTargetId`, `consumedSlimeId` to `Slime` interface; added `colorTargetCodex`, `shapeCodex`, `shapeTargetCodex` to `LabState`; updated `luaSlimeToTs` and `slimeToLua` to roundtrip all three fields.
- `gameLogic.ts`: Added `SHAPE_TARGETS` constant (23 entries matching `data.yaml` `shape_targets`).
- `App.tsx`: Breeding handler now updates `colorTargetCodex` and `shapeTargetCodex` when a child matches a target; tracks `lastConsumedSlimeId` for UI display.
- `SlimeDexTab.tsx`: Added "Morphological Shape Targets" grid section mirroring the Color Targets grid, with a full detail panel showing vertex count, irregularity, tier, and clues for locked shapes.
- `RosterTab.tsx`: Surfaces `consumedSlimeId` in the breeding result UI as a highlighted "Specimen Consumed" banner.

### The "Lua computes it, TS drops it" bug class
This is a recurring pattern: Lua logic correctly computes and attaches fields to game objects, but the TypeScript conversion layer (`luaSlimeToTs`) silently drops fields it doesn't explicitly map. The Color Codex target detection was wired in Lua but never surfaced to the TS frontend. The Shape Codex detection had the same gap. The `consumed_slime_id` field was set by Lua's breeding logic but never displayed in the UI. The fix is always the same: add the field to the TS interface, parse it in `luaSlimeToTs`, and wire it into the React state and UI components.

### Files touched

## SlimeWorld Shape Codex Target Detection — COMPLETED

### What changed
Added the real 17-vertex-count Shape taxonomy and detection system. Previously, `shape_targets` in `data.yaml` had only 11 entries (Tier 1/2 clean shapes + Tier 5/6 star polygons) — 6 real constructible-polygon names were missing entirely. Added all 6, added `vertex_tolerance` to all 23 entries (17 existing + 6 new), implemented `match_shape_target(vertex_count, irregularity, shape_targets)` in `logic.lua`, and wired it into `initiate_breeding` alongside the existing `match_color_target` call.

### Tier 4 mislabeling corrected
The existing design docs labelled "Tier 4: Quartic (15, 16, 20)" — this is mathematically wrong. All three have φ(n) = 8 (a power of 2), meaning they are genuinely constructible with compass and straightedge. They are now correctly classified as **Tier 3 — Elaborate** (constructible, but requiring two nested quadratic steps). The real Tier 4 is vertex count 17 (Heptadecagon, φ(17) = 16, degree 8 — the hardest constructible polygon, proven by Gauss in 1796).

### Corrected 6-tier taxonomy (17 vertex counts)
| Tier | Real basis | Vertex counts | Names |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Trivial | degree 1 | 3, 4, 6 | Triangle, Square, Hexagon |
| 2 — Simple | degree 2 | 5, 8, 10, 12 | Pentagon, Octagon, Decagon, Dodecagon |
| 3 — Elaborate | degree 4, two nested quadratic steps | 15, 16, 20 | Pentadecagon, Hexadecagon, Icosagon |
| 4 — Master | degree 8, hardest constructible (Gauss 1796) | 17 | Heptadecagon |
| 5 — Cubic | non-constructible, needs angle trisection | 7, 9, 14, 18 | Heptagon, Nonagon, Tetradecagon, Octadecagon (star-polygon variants: Star, Spiked, Crescent, Crown, Prism, Arrow, Teardrop, Crystal) |
| 6 — Quintic | non-constructible, unsolvable by radicals | 11, 22 | Hendecagon, Icosidigon (star-polygon variants: Void-Form, Celestial, Prismatic) |

### 6 new shape_targets added
- `shape_decagon` — Tier 2, vc=10, tol=0.5, irr 0-15
- `shape_dodecagon` — Tier 2, vc=12, tol=0.5, irr 0-15
- `shape_pentadecagon` — Tier 3, vc=15, tol=0.49, irr 0-15
- `shape_hexadecagon` — Tier 3, vc=16, tol=0.49, irr 0-15
- `shape_heptadecagon` — Tier 4, vc=17, tol=0.49, irr 0-15
- `shape_icosagon` — Tier 3, vc=20, tol=0.5, irr 0-15

### vertex_tolerance added to all existing entries
All 17 existing entries lacked `vertex_tolerance`. Added `0.5` to each. The 3 new consecutive clean entries (15/16/17) use `0.49` instead of `0.5` to prevent overlap at midpoints 15.5 and 16.5 — all three share the same irregularity band (0-15), so 0.5 tolerance would create ambiguous matches. 0.49 eliminates the overlap with minimal tightening.

### Adjacent-entry overlap check
With 14/15/16/17/18 now all present and only 1 apart, a real check was required:

| Boundary | Adjacent entries | Irregularity bands | Overlap? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14.5 | Prism/Arrow (14, irr 40-100) vs Pentadecagon (15, irr 0-15) | Different | No |
| 15.5 | Pentadecagon (15, irr 0-15) vs Hexadecagon (16, irr 0-15) | Same — **fixed with 0.49 tolerance** | No (was yes at 0.5) |
| 16.5 | Hexadecagon (16, irr 0-15) vs Heptadecagon (17, irr 0-15) | Same — **fixed with 0.49 tolerance** | No (was yes at 0.5) |
| 17.5 | Heptadecagon (17, irr 0-15) vs Teardrop/Crystal (18, irr 40-100) | Different | No |

Pre-existing overlaps (not in scope to fix): Triangle(3)/Square(4) at 3.5, Square(4)/Pentagon(5) at 4.5, Pentagon(5)/Hexagon(6) at 5.5 — all share `irregularity_max: 15`, resolved by first-match-wins ordering.

### Detection algorithm
`match_shape_target` iterates targets in order. For each: if `|vertex_count - target.vertex_count| <= vertex_tolerance`, check if irregularity falls within `[irregularity_min or 0, irregularity_max or 100]`. First match wins. Returns `nil` if no match. Same shape as `match_color_target`.

### Wiring into initiate_breeding
Single line added after `match_color_target` call:
```lua
child.matched_shape_target_id = match_shape_target(child.vertex_count, child.irregularity, shape_targets)
```
Runs on every breed, not gated behind `active_shape_target`. `breed_shape`'s existing biasing logic unchanged.

### Files touched
- `games/slimeworld/data.yaml` — 6 new shape_targets, `vertex_tolerance` added to all 23 entries, header comment updated with corrected taxonomy
- `games/slimeworld/logic.lua` — added `match_shape_target` (13 lines), wired into `initiate_breeding` (1 line)
- `tests/test_slimeworld_shape_codex.py` — new, 8 test anchors

### Verification
```text
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --tb=no
-> 388 passed, 8 warnings (was 380, +8 new tests)
```

### Deferred, real, separate follow-ups
- **Shape Codex bookkeeping**: discovery/inventory tracking for shape targets — parallel to the Color Codex bookkeeping deferral
- **UI display of Shape Codex progress**: Lua/data-layer only for now
- **Vertex counts 13, 19, 21**: real and valid, but outside the confirmed 17-count taxonomy
- **"Disturbed" variants of new Tier 3/4 shapes**: only clean forms added; high-irregularity variants deferred

## SlimeWorld Color Codex Target Detection — COMPLETED

### What changed
Added the real 17-target Color Codex detection system from the v0.1.0R2 source (`gameLogic.ts` lines 314-339 for `COLOR_TARGETS`, line 341 for `matchColorTarget`). Previously, `initiate_breeding` already biased child hue toward `active_target_regent` via `breed_slimes`, but nothing checked whether the resulting child actually landed inside a real target zone. Now `match_color_target(hue, saturation, color_targets)` runs on every breed and sets `child.matched_target_id`.

### 17 targets in data.yaml (4 tiers, matching fresh TS source exactly)
**6 Guilds** (adjacent capitol pairs, tight tolerance, high saturation):
- `guild_ember_marsh` → Thornward (center 30, tol 15, sat 65–100)
- `guild_marsh_gale` → Amberglow (center 90, tol 15, sat 65–100)
- `guild_gale_tundra` → Frostwind (center 150, tol 15, sat 65–100)
- `guild_tundra_crystal` → Mossy Crystal (center 210, tol 15, sat 65–100)
- `guild_crystal_tide` → Tidereign (center 270, tol 15, sat 65–100)
- `guild_tide_ember` → Abyssal Ember (center 330, tol 15, sat 65–100)

**3 Rivals** (opposite capitol pairs, wider tolerance, lower saturation):
- `rival_ember_tundra` → The Fault Line (centers [90, 270], tol 10, sat 35–65)
- `rival_marsh_crystal` → Eclipse Void (centers [150, 330], tol 10, sat 35–65)
- `rival_gale_tide` → Stormsurge (centers [210, 30], tol 10, sat 35–65)

**6 Arc Triads** (3 consecutive capitols, low saturation):
- `arc_ember_marsh_gale` → Arc: Ember-Marsh-Gale (center 60, tol 15, sat 20–35)
- `arc_marsh_gale_tundra` → Arc: Marsh-Gale-Tundra (center 120, tol 15, sat 20–35)
- `arc_gale_tundra_crystal` → Arc: Gale-Tundra-Crystal (center 180, tol 15, sat 20–35)
- `arc_tundra_crystal_tide` → Arc: Tundra-Crystal-Tide (center 240, tol 15, sat 20–35)
- `arc_crystal_tide_ember` → Arc: Crystal-Tide-Ember (center 300, tol 15, sat 20–35)
- `arc_tide_ember_marsh` → Arc: Tide-Ember-Marsh (center 0, tol 15, sat 20–35)

**2 Skip Triads** (3 alternating capitols, very low saturation):
- `skip_ember_gale_crystal` → Skip: Ember-Gale-Crystal (centers [0, 120, 240], tol 10, sat 15–20)
- `skip_marsh_tundra_tide` → Skip: Marsh-Tundra-Tide (centers [60, 180, 300], tol 10, sat 15–20)

All 17 targets match the fresh TS source `COLOR_TARGETS` array (line 314-339) and the locked Rev3 design memory exactly.

### Detection algorithm
`match_color_target` iterates targets in order. For each: if saturation falls within `[saturation_min, saturation_max)`, check each `center_hue` — if `circular_distance(hue, center) <= tolerance`, return the target's `id`. First match wins. Returns `nil` if no match. Reuses existing `circular_distance` function — no hue math reimplemented.

### Wiring into initiate_breeding
Single line added after accent computation, before `table.insert`:
```lua
child.matched_target_id = match_color_target(child.hue, child.saturation, color_targets)
```
Runs on every breed regardless of whether `active_target_regent` is set — a player breeding without an active target can still accidentally land in a real zone. Does NOT change `breed_slimes`'s existing hue-biasing behavior.

### Files touched
- `games/slimeworld/data.yaml` — all 17 color_targets confirmed present (6 Guilds, 3 Rivals, 6 Arc Triads, 2 Skip Triads), matching fresh TS source exactly
- `games/slimeworld/logic.lua` — added `match_color_target` (12 lines), wired into `initiate_breeding` (1 line)
- `tests/test_slimeworld_color_codex.py` — new, 9 test anchors

### Verification
```text
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --tb=no
-> 380 passed, 8 warnings (was 371, +9 new tests)
```

### Deferred, real, separate follow-ups
- **`syncCodexWithRoster` bookkeeping**: full discovery/inventory tracking (`colorCodex`, `patternCodex`, `colorTargetCodex`, Regent inventory counts) — real, related, genuinely separate future work
- **Shape Codex detection**: `shape_targets`/`active_shape_target` already exist as parameters in `initiate_breeding`, following the same unwired pattern — parallel gap, deliberately not bundled
- **UI display of Codex progress**: Lua/data-layer only for now
- **Regent purchase costs**: `getColorRegentCost`/`getTargetRegentCost` are real and understood, wiring is separate from detection

## SlimeWorld World Map Fix (planetRegion Never Generated) — COMPLETED (v2: 20-Node Replacement)

### Root cause
`App.tsx` initialized `planetRegion: null` in `createInitialState`. Nothing ever transitioned it from `null` to a real value. The World Map in the Missions tab was permanently stuck on "UNEXPLORED REGION" placeholder.

### Initial fix (this morning, now superseded)
Ported `generatePlanetRegion()` from `intake/slimegarden/extracted/src/gameLogic.ts` — but that source was five days stale (dated July 13), describing an older 8-node map. The wiring was correct (and remains unchanged), but the data was wrong.

### Replacement (this morning, v2)
Robert provided a fresh export (`slimegarden_v0.1.0R2`, promoted through the intake pipeline). The real, current `generatePlanetRegion()` describes a **20-node map across three concentric rings**. Rewrote `planetRegion.ts` with the real source data (from ~line 1391 of the updated `gameLogic.ts`). `App.tsx` wiring unchanged — same call, just returns richer data now.

### Real node definitions (ported exactly from v0.1.0R2 source)

**6 Capitols (R=180, 60° spacing):**
- **node_ember** — Ember, Red, strength 0.8, discovered
- **node_marsh** — Marsh, Orange, strength 0.8, discovered
- **node_gale** — Gale, Yellow, strength 0.8, discovered
- **node_tundra** — Tundra, Green, strength 0.8, discovered
- **node_crystal** — Crystal, Purple, strength 0.8, discovered
- **node_tide** — Tide, Blue, strength 0.8, discovered

**6 Frontier nodes (R=75, 30° offset from capitols):**
- **node_frontier_a** — Frontier Alpha, neutral, pressure: {Red:15, Orange:15}
- **node_frontier_b** — Frontier Beta, neutral, pressure: {Yellow:15, Green:15}
- **node_frontier_c** — Frontier Gamma, neutral, pressure: {Purple:15, Blue:15}
- **node_frontier_d** — Frontier Delta, neutral, pressure: {Red:10, Blue:15, Yellow:10}
- **node_frontier_e** — Frontier Epsilon, neutral, pressure: {Orange:10, Green:15}
- **node_frontier_f** — Frontier Zeta, neutral, pressure: {Yellow:10, Purple:15}

**8 Midpoint nodes (R=125, 22.5° spacing):**
- **node_mid_a** — Midpoint Alpha, neutral, pressure: {Red:20}
- **node_mid_b** — Midpoint Beta, neutral, pressure: {Orange:20}
- **node_mid_c** — Midpoint Gamma, neutral, pressure: {Yellow:20}
- **node_mid_d** — Midpoint Delta, neutral, pressure: {Green:20}
- **node_mid_e** — Midpoint Epsilon, neutral, pressure: {Purple:20}
- **node_mid_f** — Midpoint Zeta, neutral, pressure: {Blue:20}
- **node_mid_g** — Midpoint Eta, neutral, pressure: {Red:10, Blue:10}
- **node_mid_h** — Midpoint Theta, neutral, pressure: {Yellow:10, Orange:10}

All non-capitol nodes: `ownerColor: null`, `strength: 0`, `isCapitol: false`, `isSupplied: false`, `discovered: false`.

### Key differences from v1 (8-node)
- 20 nodes instead of 8 (6 capitols, 6 frontier, 8 midpoint vs 5 capitols, 3 neutral)
- Three concentric rings (R=75, R=125, R=180) instead of two (R=90, R=225)
- Adjacency computed on-the-fly from polygon proximity (tolerance 0.1) instead of hardcoded `NEIGHBORS_MAP`
- `geometryVersion: 3` (was absent in v1)
- All 6 SlimeColors represented as capitols (was 5 of 7)

### Field compatibility
Confirmed `PlanetNode` shape matches `luaNodeToTs`/`nodeToLua` and `MissionsTab.tsx` rendering. More nodes doesn't change individual node data shape. Optional `garrisonSlimeId` still unset by generator — fine, it's optional.

### Cleanup noted
`games/slimegarden/` (separate Lua genetics port, confirmed redundant) removed along with its equivalence tests. Python floor correctly dropped 412→371 — not a regression.

### Deferred future work
The fresh export's `gameLogic.ts` contains a real Color Codex / Guilds-Rivals genetics system — substantial, confirmed-present, deliberately deferred as separate future work. Not bundled into this map-geometry fix.

### Files touched
- `ts/src/games/slimeworld/planetRegion.ts` (rewritten — 20-node version)
- `ts/tests/test_slimeworld_planet_region.tsx` (rewritten — 7 new anchors for 20-node structure)
- `App.tsx` unchanged (wiring from v1 still correct)

## SlimeWorld UI Real Tab Extraction — COMPLETED

### What changed
- Physically moved Collection, Splicing, and SlimeDex JSX blocks from `LabTab.tsx` into `RosterTab.tsx` with local `activeSubTab` state and its own `TabBar`.
- Physically moved Requisitions (Contracts + Market) JSX block from `LabTab.tsx` into `EconomyTab.tsx` with local `activeSubTab` state.
- Physically moved all PlanetTab content (Territory/Regions, Active, Zones, Mediation, Exploration) into `MissionsTab.tsx` with local `activeSubTab` and `selectedNodeId` state and its own `TabBar`.
- Reduced `LabTab.tsx` to contain only the Upgrades section (308 lines, down from 1332).
- Deleted `PlanetTab.tsx` entirely (was 1976 lines).
- Updated `App.tsx` to route four primary tabs: Roster, Missions, Economy, Lab.
- No facade imports remain: `RosterTab.tsx`, `MissionsTab.tsx`, and `EconomyTab.tsx` contain zero `import { LabTab }` or `import { PlanetTab }` statements.
- Updated `test_slimeworld_labtab.tsx` to read from `RosterTab.tsx` (shared UI content moved there).
- Rewrote `test_slimeworld_tab_extraction.tsx` with 7 structural anchors verifying no facade imports, PlanetTab deletion, LabTab line count reduction, and presence of specific JSX markers in each extracted component.

### Line count proof

  MissionsTab.tsx:  30 lines (facade)

After:
  LabTab.tsx:     308 lines (Upgrades only)
  PlanetTab.tsx:  deleted
  RosterTab.tsx:  730 lines (Collection + Splicing + SlimeDex)
  EconomyTab.tsx: 581 lines (Contracts + Market)

## Tier Economics + Richer Wanderer Petitions — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added `get_color_tier`, `get_shape_tier`, and `calculate_tier_value` to `games/slimeworld/logic.lua`. The tier-value curve `TIER_VALUE = {1:5, 2:22, 3:95, 4:300}` is now available for callers while `sell_on_market`'s signature remains unchanged.
- `create_wanderer_petition` now rolls color and shape requirements independently (~70% each) and guarantees at least one is set, allowing color-only, shape-only, and mixed petitions.
- Petition rewards are computed as `color_tier × shape_tier × 10 × WANDERER_PREMIUM_MULTI` (default 1.5 for a missing requirement).
- `fulfill_petition` checks `nil` requirements correctly: a color-only petition accepts any matching color, a shape-only petition accepts any matching shape, and mixed petitions require both.

### Flagged assumptions
- `Gray` is assigned Tier 1; this is a SlimeWorld-specific low-saturation default, not derived from SlimeBreeder source.
- SlimeWorld's current color set reaches only Tiers 1–2, so the Tier 3–4 color values (95/300) are not reachable until Tier 3–4 color names are added in the separate deferred directive.
- Shape tiers already cover the full 1–4 range via `snap_to_shape_name`.

### Verification

Focused anchors (`test_slimeworld_tier_economics.py` + `test_slimeworld_wanderer_petitions.py`) all passed:

- Partial petition fulfillment (color-only / shape-only) and rejections
- Reward scales with tier product, not a flat multiplier

### Still deferred
- Tier 3–4 color names
- Regent system design
- Full Culture-sourced Requisitions board

## Current Phase

**Worker Income + Garden Refugee Default — CERTIFIED**

## Worker Income + Garden Refugee Default — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Confirmed `advance_cycle` invokes the existing `calculate_worker_income` for each worker-role slime using the real `has_auto_feeder` upgrade flag and matching-culture planet nodes. Added regression anchors for base income, non-worker exclusion, and both multipliers.
- Changed territory-flip refugees to enter the Garden as workers rather than dispatch/combat assets. The generated stray log now reports the same Worker assignment, preserving tonight's Garden-as-hostel GDD decision.

Per-role roster caps, Legacy Slimes, squad-swap cooldowns, and the permanent-ownership/contestable-upgrade question remain deferred.

## Tier Economics + Richer Wanderer Petitions — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added SlimeWorld color/shape tier lookup and `calculate_tier_value(color, shape, variance)`. The existing manual `sell_on_market(state, slime_id, price)` signature remains unchanged.
- Wanderer Petitions now independently roll color and shape requirements at the source's 70% rate, guarantee at least one request, use the real `1.5` default tier for a missing requirement, and persist the tier-scaled reward.
- Petition fulfillment already guarded optional requirements with nil checks; it now pays the stored tier-scaled reward.

### Economics notes

- Hand-verified `calculate_tier_value`: Red/Triangle = 10, Orange/Star = 44, Purple/Crown = 322; Orange/Crown with 25% variance = 403.
- SlimeWorld's current colors can reach tiers 1–2 only. Tier 3–4 color names remain deferred, so the asymmetry with the shape tier range (1–4) is expected, not a bug.
- Gray is assigned Tier 1 as a SlimeWorld-specific low-saturation assumption; it is not confirmed by SlimeBreeder source.

The Regent-system question and the full Culture-sourced Requisitions/Petitions board remain open and are not implied resolved here.

## Shape Naming, Breeding Cost, Wanderer Petitions — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added `snap_to_shape_name(vertex_count, irregularity)`, a nearest-anchor display label for the ten real SlimeBreeder shape names. The anchors retain the decided coordinates because `breed_shape` produces vertices across `3–22` and clamps irregularity to `0–100`; it remains completely independent of continuous shape breeding math.
- Changed SlimeWorld breeding to consume only the donor (`parent_b`) after a child is fully created and inserted. Existing continuous 50/50 midpoint inheritance remains intact and takes precedence over SlimeBreeder's distinct 60/40 discrete host/donor tuning. Failed same-parent, capacity, and missing-parent exits all occur before mutation. Successful results include `consumed_slime_id` for future UI confirmation.
- Added Wanderer-only Petition creation and fulfillment: three active petitions maximum, `3.0x` premium multiplier, color-and-shape matching, payout, removal on fulfillment, and expiration handling. The schema is present in `data.yaml`.

### Verification

```text
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --tb=no

```

The complete Requisitions/Petitions system for Culture-sourced requests remains future work. The SlimeBreeder Regent system remains a separate, unresolved design question. Tier 3/4 color snap names and redundant `games/slimegarden/` cleanup are also still deferred.

## SlimeGarden Genetics Core, First Lua Port Slice — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added `games/slimegarden/data.yaml` and `games/slimegarden/logic.lua` for the eight self-contained genetics functions: naming, color/pattern breeding, life stages, stat calculation, offspring creation, and seed creation.
- Confirmed exact schema alignment with Slimeworld for colors, patterns, life stages, `hp`/`atk`/`def`/`agi`/`int`/`chm` stats, parent lineage, role vocabulary, and timestamps.
- Added a real-source equivalence suite that transpiles and executes the extracted SlimeGarden `gameLogic.ts`, controls its `Math.random()` stream, and compares it to Lua with the same stream. Runtime-specific IDs and timestamps are normalized because the TypeScript source uses `Date.now()` while Lua uses `os.time()`.

### RNG finding

The studio executor provides seeded Lua RNG via `math.randomseed(seed)`. `engine/primitives/resolution.lua` does not provide a seeded-RNG abstraction and no game directly seeds Lua RNG. The original TypeScript source also exposes no seed API and calls native `Math.random()`. Tests therefore use matching controlled random streams; this proves branch-for-branch equivalence without falsely claiming that JavaScript and Lua share a PRNG sequence.

This is slice 1 of SlimeGarden's port. Corporate, dispatch, mediation, economy, planet/territory, and full studio runtime/Arcade wiring remain future work. SVG polygon-clipping geometry remains in TypeScript permanently. SlimeBreeder receives its own port directive later.

## Shared UI, First Real Migration (Slimeworld) — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Extended the shared `Button` with optional `icon`, `title`, and additive `className` support while retaining label-only callers; development builds warn for a button with neither label nor icon.
- Migrated Slimeworld's rename confirm and cancel controls to icon-only shared `Button` instances.
- Migrated both state-specific full-width worker-role controls to shared `Button` instances. The narrow `className` escape hatch preserves their existing Slimeworld-specific colors, hover effects, sizing, and glow.
- Migrated the Slimeworld HP display to `StatBar` with its existing value and a `200` maximum.
- Investigated `Card`: its shared base styling was generic, but its hardcoded `horse-card` class caused every Card to inherit Horse Racing-specific descendant selectors such as `.horse-card .stat-row`. Renamed the shared base class to `card-base`; Horse Racing retains its explicit `className="horse-card"` behavior.
- Added Button icon/compatibility/className regression anchors and Slimeworld migration anchors.

→ Post-change: 91 passed, 0 failed
```

This is the first slice of an ongoing UI-sharing effort. Full Slimeworld migration and migrations for other games remain future work; this phase does not imply either is complete.

## ADR-009 Shared Lua Utilities — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added ADR-009, explicitly superseding ADR-005 only for generic, non-game-specific Lua utilities.
- `collect` is supplied by `engine/primitives/action.lua`; horse racing uses the preloaded engine global.
- Slime Coin uses the existing engine `copy_entity` shallow-copy primitive and has no local `copy_table`.
- `atan2` is supplied by `engine/primitives/movement.lua`; Slither Rogue uses the preloaded engine global.
- Added Python regression anchors for utility equivalence, removal of the former locals, deterministic race creation, and the Slime Coin flow.

### Loading finding

No Lua `require()`, `loadfile()`, or `package.path` precedent exists in the repository. The established runtime bridge is `studio.loader.load_engine_source()`, which concatenates all primitives in deterministic order before game Lua is executed. This ADR uses that existing loading mechanism; it does not introduce module-path loading.

### Verification

```text
python -m pytest -q --tb=no
→ Pre-flight: 321 passed, 8 warnings
→ Post-change: 329 passed, 8 warnings

cd ts && npx vitest run
→ Pre-flight: 41 passed, 8 failed (49 total)
→ Post-change: 84 passed, 0 failed (84 total)
→ `GameSelector` renders the authoritative `GAME_REGISTRY` order; routing assertions pass.
```

Further shared-logic consolidation beyond `collect`, `copy_table`→`copy_entity`, and `atan2` is a future decision; ADR-009 does not imply permission to share game-specific logic.

## External Game Entries (VoidDrift) — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Extended `GameConfig` in `ts/src/engine/types.ts`: `component` is now optional, added `externalUrl?: string`, added `'external'` to `GameStatus`.
- `GameSelector.tsx` click handler branches: cards with `externalUrl` open via `window.open` in a new tab; internal cards use `navigateTo` unchanged.
- `GameLoader.tsx` guards against external games: if someone manually navigates `?game=voiddrift`, it opens the itch.io URL and redirects home; also handles missing `component` gracefully with a fallback error screen.
- Created `ts/src/games/voiddrift/config.ts` with `externalUrl: 'https://rdug627.itch.io/voidrift'`, `status: 'external'`, no `component` field.
- Registered VoidDrift in `GAME_REGISTRY` in `ts/src/games/registry.ts`.
- Added `.arcade-status--external` CSS badge styling in `ts/src/ui/base.css`.
- External cards show "Rust/Bevy · itch.io" as their runtime detail instead of attempting `loadGameFiles`.

## Shared Marquee Identity — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added display and monospace font tokens plus a marquee glow custom property to `ts/src/ui/tokens.css`.
- Wrote real CSS for the nine base UI components in `ts/src/ui/base.css` and added a shared GameShell marquee header treatment.
- Refactored `ts/src/components/GameShell.tsx` to a structured contract: `gameLabel`, `gameId`, `phase?`, `statusArea?`, `children`, `footer?`, `className?`.
- Migrated every game App to the new `GameShell` contract: ScrapCrawl, Chimera Wilds, Mutant Battle Ball, Slime Coin, Horse Racing, and Slither Rogue.
- Removed the duplicate `arcade-game-nav` bar from `ts/src/arcade/GameLoader.tsx`; GameShell now owns the back button and title treatment.
- For Horse Racing, suppressed the interpreter-rendered `ui-header`/`ui-tab-bar`/`ui-footer` copies so the GameShell header and the game's own tab/footer are the only ones shown, while leaving `games/horse_racing/ui.yaml` intact for the PyGame renderer.
- Redesigned `ts/src/arcade/GameSelector.tsx` with a marquee title, cabinet-frame cards, and a per-card runtime detail line derived from each game's real `data.yaml` (rooms, parts, race classes, evolution cards, chip cards, etc.) plus the confirmed PyGame renderer roster.
- Added `ts/tests/test_gameshell.tsx` (6 tests) and extended `ts/tests/test_arcade.ts` with GameSelector runtime detail tests (6 tests).

### Hotfix
- `countArray()` in `ts/src/arcade/GameSelector.tsx` now counts object keys as well as array lengths, so ScrapCrawl's keyed `rooms` object correctly renders **5 rooms** instead of silently returning 0.
- `ts/tests/test_arcade_routing.ts` — `test_game_loader_back_button_returns_clean_url` hardened with `vi.waitFor` (5s timeout, 20ms interval) instead of a bare `setTimeout(r, 0)`, removing the 1-in-8 timing race against the async `loadGame()` effect.

## Arcade Core System Hardening — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Extracted the Arcade shell (routing, selector, loader) from `ts/src/main.tsx` into a dedicated `ts/src/arcade/` module with a barrel export, matching the existing `hooks/`, `components/`, and `engine/` structure.
- Moved `getGameId`, `navigateTo`, and `navigateHome` to `ts/src/arcade/routing.ts` with no semantic drift for `navigateHome`.
- Fixed `navigateTo` so it preserves the current mount path (e.g., `/arcade/rfdgamestudio/`) when setting `?game={id}`, closing the same path-portability risk that `navigateHome` already handled.
- Moved `GameSelector` and `GameLoader` to `ts/src/arcade/GameSelector.tsx` and `ts/src/arcade/GameLoader.tsx`.
- Closed the registry-mismatch bug: `GameLoader` now calls `findGame()` after a successful `loadGame()` and shows a distinct error when a game exists on disk but is missing from `GAME_REGISTRY`.
- Removed the now-unused `findGameOrDefault()` from `ts/src/games/registry.ts`; no other callers existed.
- Replaced the `ts/tests/test_navigation.ts` file with `ts/tests/test_arcade_routing.ts`, extending it with the new Arcade tests.

### What was verified, not assumed
- A genuinely bad `?game=totally_fake_id` URL still fails correctly with the existing `Unknown game: ...` error from `loadGame()`. This path was already fine and was not touched.
- The registry-mismatch scenario was reproduced by temporarily removing `scrapcrawl` from `GAME_REGISTRY` while leaving its files on disk. `GameLoader` rendered the new distinct error: `Game "scrapcrawl" loaded successfully but has no registered config in registry.ts — this is a studio configuration error...`. The registry was restored immediately after the trace.

## ScrapCrawl Phase A.1 — Combat + Craft Gating Fix + UI Design Pass — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Fixed a real bug discovered by playing: `resolve_fight` and the `Fight` button both lacked room-type validation, allowing free infinite wins at Home Base (no `difficulty` field → `difficulty` defaulted to `0`).
- Added a defensive backend guard in `logic.lua` that rejects fights in rooms without `fight` in their interaction types.
- Added a frontend gate in `App.tsx` that renders the `Fight` button as disabled in safe rooms.
- Fixed a second play-discovered bug: `craft`/`can_craft` took no room context, allowing crafting in any node. They now accept a `room` parameter and reject rooms without `craft` in their interaction types.
- Added a frontend craft-room gate in `App.tsx` that disables all craft buttons outside Home Base (the only craft-capable node) and shows a "No workbench detected" tooltip.
- Redesigned the ScrapCrawl UI to match the original `examples/scrapcrawl` identity: near-black canvas, equipment durability bars with threshold colour shift, proficiency bars, terminal-style combat trace, and crafting catalog cards.
- Rewrote `styles.css` using the shared token layer from `ui/tokens.css`; only deliberate hex override is the signature background `#07090d`, documented in-file.
- Added 3 Python and 2 TypeScript tests anchoring the fight gating fix, plus 3 Python and 2 TypeScript tests anchoring the craft gating fix.

### Hotfix (fengari numeric keys + Tool re-craft button + executor boolean bug)
- The TS runtime (`fengari-web`) passes JavaScript numbers as Lua floats (`1.0`) and YAML numeric keys as strings (`"1"`). `lookup_tier` in `logic.lua` now tries numeric, integer, and string forms so that `craft`, `can_craft`, and `resolve_fight` all work in the browser. A TS runtime regression test guards this.
- The Tier 2 craft button for the Tool recipe was incorrectly enabled after Tier 2 was unlocked (it looked affordable once the lock disappeared). Both Tool tier buttons are now disabled once the Tool has been crafted, matching the one-time-gate semantics in `logic.lua`.
- `executor.ts` was returning `true` for every pulled Lua boolean because `lua_toboolean` returns a JS boolean and `false !== 0` is `true`. It now returns the actual boolean value. Two executor tests guard this.

- `resolve_fight` — compliant (ADR-007 worked example).
- `init_player` — compliant (`init_` prefix).
- `reset_position` — renamed from `wipe`; flagged as a naming call because `wipe` does not cleanly fit any locked verb.
