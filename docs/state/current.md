# RFDGameStudio — Project State

*Last updated: July 2026*

## Current Phase

**Tier Economics + Richer Wanderer Petitions — CERTIFIED**

## Tier Economics + Richer Wanderer Petitions — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added SlimeWorld color/shape tier lookup and `calculate_tier_value(color, shape, variance)`. The existing manual `sell_on_market(state, slime_id, price)` signature remains unchanged.
- Wanderer Petitions now independently roll color and shape requirements at the source's 70% rate, guarantee at least one request, use the real `1.5` default tier for a missing requirement, and persist the tier-scaled reward.
- Petition fulfillment already guarded optional requirements with nil checks; it now pays the stored tier-scaled reward.

### Economics notes

- Hand-verified `calculate_tier_value`: Red/Triangle = 10, Orange/Star = 44, Purple/Crown = 322; Orange/Crown with 25% variance = 403.
- SlimeWorld's current colors can reach tiers 1–2 only. Tier 3–4 color names remain deferred, so the asymmetry with the shape tier range (1–4) is expected, not a bug.
- Gray is assigned Tier 1 as a SlimeWorld-specific low-saturation assumption; it is not confirmed by SlimeBreeder source.

### Verification

.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --tb=no
→ Pre-flight: 380 passed, 8 warnings
→ Focused anchors: 31 passed
→ Post-change: 407 passed, 8 warnings
```

The Regent-system question and the full Culture-sourced Requisitions/Petitions board remain open and are not implied resolved here.

## Shape Naming, Breeding Cost, Wanderer Petitions — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added `snap_to_shape_name(vertex_count, irregularity)`, a nearest-anchor display label for the ten real SlimeBreeder shape names. The anchors retain the decided coordinates because `breed_shape` produces vertices across `3–22` and clamps irregularity to `0–100`; it remains completely independent of continuous shape breeding math.
- Changed SlimeWorld breeding to consume only the donor (`parent_b`) after a child is fully created and inserted. Existing continuous 50/50 midpoint inheritance remains intact and takes precedence over SlimeBreeder's distinct 60/40 discrete host/donor tuning. Failed same-parent, capacity, and missing-parent exits all occur before mutation. Successful results include `consumed_slime_id` for future UI confirmation.
- Added Wanderer-only Petition creation and fulfillment: three active petitions maximum, `3.0x` premium multiplier, color-and-shape matching, payout, removal on fulfillment, and expiration handling. The schema is present in `data.yaml`.

### Verification

```text
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q --tb=no
→ Pre-flight: 370 passed, 8 warnings
→ Focused anchors: 10 passed
→ Post-change: 380 passed, 8 warnings
```

The complete Requisitions/Petitions system for Culture-sourced requests remains future work. The SlimeBreeder Regent system remains a separate, unresolved design question. Tier 3/4 color snap names and redundant `games/slimegarden/` cleanup are also still deferred.

## SlimeGarden Genetics Core, First Lua Port Slice — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added `games/slimegarden/data.yaml` and `games/slimegarden/logic.lua` for the eight self-contained genetics functions: naming, color/pattern breeding, life stages, stat calculation, offspring creation, and seed creation.
- Confirmed exact schema alignment with Slimeworld for colors, patterns, life stages, `hp`/`atk`/`def`/`agi`/`int`/`chm` stats, parent lineage, role vocabulary, and timestamps.
- Added a real-source equivalence suite that transpiles and executes the extracted SlimeGarden `gameLogic.ts`, controls its `Math.random()` stream, and compares it to Lua with the same stream. Runtime-specific IDs and timestamps are normalized because the TypeScript source uses `Date.now()` while Lua uses `os.time()`.

### RNG finding

The studio executor provides seeded Lua RNG via `math.randomseed(seed)`. `engine/primitives/resolution.lua` does not provide a seeded-RNG abstraction and no game directly seeds Lua RNG. The original TypeScript source also exposes no seed API and calls native `Math.random()`. Tests therefore use matching controlled random streams; this proves branch-for-branch equivalence without falsely claiming that JavaScript and Lua share a PRNG sequence.

### Verification

```text
python -m pytest -q --tb=no
→ Pre-flight: 329 passed, 8 warnings
→ Genetics equivalence anchors: 41 passed
→ Post-change: 370 passed, 8 warnings
```

This is slice 1 of SlimeGarden's port. Corporate, dispatch, mediation, economy, planet/territory, and full studio runtime/Arcade wiring remain future work. SVG polygon-clipping geometry remains in TypeScript permanently. SlimeBreeder receives its own port directive later.

## Shared UI, First Real Migration (Slimeworld) — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Extended the shared `Button` with optional `icon`, `title`, and additive `className` support while retaining label-only callers; development builds warn for a button with neither label nor icon.
- Migrated Slimeworld's rename confirm and cancel controls to icon-only shared `Button` instances.
- Migrated both state-specific full-width worker-role controls to shared `Button` instances. The narrow `className` escape hatch preserves their existing Slimeworld-specific colors, hover effects, sizing, and glow.
- Migrated the Slimeworld HP display to `StatBar` with its existing value and a `200` maximum.
- Investigated `Card`: its shared base styling was generic, but its hardcoded `horse-card` class caused every Card to inherit Horse Racing-specific descendant selectors such as `.horse-card .stat-row`. Renamed the shared base class to `card-base`; Horse Racing retains its explicit `className="horse-card"` behavior.
- Added Button icon/compatibility/className regression anchors and Slimeworld migration anchors.

### Verification

```text
python -m pytest -q --tb=no
→ Pre-flight: 329 passed, 8 warnings
→ Post-change: 329 passed, 8 warnings

cd ts && npx vitest run
→ Pre-flight: 84 passed, 0 failed
→ Focused shared UI anchors: 7 passed
→ Post-change: 91 passed, 0 failed
```

This is the first slice of an ongoing UI-sharing effort. Full Slimeworld migration and migrations for other games remain future work; this phase does not imply either is complete.

## ADR-009 Shared Lua Utilities — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added ADR-009, explicitly superseding ADR-005 only for generic, non-game-specific Lua utilities.
- `collect` is supplied by `engine/primitives/action.lua`; horse racing uses the preloaded engine global.
- Slime Coin uses the existing engine `copy_entity` shallow-copy primitive and has no local `copy_table`.
- `atan2` is supplied by `engine/primitives/movement.lua`; Slither Rogue uses the preloaded engine global.
- Added Python regression anchors for utility equivalence, removal of the former locals, deterministic race creation, and the Slime Coin flow.

### Loading finding

No Lua `require()`, `loadfile()`, or `package.path` precedent exists in the repository. The established runtime bridge is `studio.loader.load_engine_source()`, which concatenates all primitives in deterministic order before game Lua is executed. This ADR uses that existing loading mechanism; it does not introduce module-path loading.

### Verification

```text
python -m pytest -q --tb=no
→ Pre-flight: 321 passed, 8 warnings
→ Post-change: 329 passed, 8 warnings

cd ts && npx vitest run
→ Pre-flight: 41 passed, 8 failed (49 total)
→ Post-change: 84 passed, 0 failed (84 total)
→ `GameSelector` renders the authoritative `GAME_REGISTRY` order; routing assertions pass.
```

Further shared-logic consolidation beyond `collect`, `copy_table`→`copy_entity`, and `atan2` is a future decision; ADR-009 does not imply permission to share game-specific logic.

## External Game Entries (VoidDrift) — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Extended `GameConfig` in `ts/src/engine/types.ts`: `component` is now optional, added `externalUrl?: string`, added `'external'` to `GameStatus`.
- `GameSelector.tsx` click handler branches: cards with `externalUrl` open via `window.open` in a new tab; internal cards use `navigateTo` unchanged.
- `GameLoader.tsx` guards against external games: if someone manually navigates `?game=voiddrift`, it opens the itch.io URL and redirects home; also handles missing `component` gracefully with a fallback error screen.
- Created `ts/src/games/voiddrift/config.ts` with `externalUrl: 'https://rdug627.itch.io/voidrift'`, `status: 'external'`, no `component` field.
- Registered VoidDrift in `GAME_REGISTRY` in `ts/src/games/registry.ts`.
- Added `.arcade-status--external` CSS badge styling in `ts/src/ui/base.css`.
- External cards show "Rust/Bevy · itch.io" as their runtime detail instead of attempting `loadGameFiles`.

### Completion Criteria

## Shared Marquee Identity — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Added display and monospace font tokens plus a marquee glow custom property to `ts/src/ui/tokens.css`.
- Wrote real CSS for the nine base UI components in `ts/src/ui/base.css` and added a shared GameShell marquee header treatment.
- Refactored `ts/src/components/GameShell.tsx` to a structured contract: `gameLabel`, `gameId`, `phase?`, `statusArea?`, `children`, `footer?`, `className?`.
- Migrated every game App to the new `GameShell` contract: ScrapCrawl, Chimera Wilds, Mutant Battle Ball, Slime Coin, Horse Racing, and Slither Rogue.
- Removed the duplicate `arcade-game-nav` bar from `ts/src/arcade/GameLoader.tsx`; GameShell now owns the back button and title treatment.
- For Horse Racing, suppressed the interpreter-rendered `ui-header`/`ui-tab-bar`/`ui-footer` copies so the GameShell header and the game's own tab/footer are the only ones shown, while leaving `games/horse_racing/ui.yaml` intact for the PyGame renderer.
- Redesigned `ts/src/arcade/GameSelector.tsx` with a marquee title, cabinet-frame cards, and a per-card runtime detail line derived from each game's real `data.yaml` (rooms, parts, race classes, evolution cards, chip cards, etc.) plus the confirmed PyGame renderer roster.
- Added `ts/tests/test_gameshell.tsx` (6 tests) and extended `ts/tests/test_arcade.ts` with GameSelector runtime detail tests (6 tests).

### Hotfix
- `countArray()` in `ts/src/arcade/GameSelector.tsx` now counts object keys as well as array lengths, so ScrapCrawl's keyed `rooms` object correctly renders **5 rooms** instead of silently returning 0.
- `ts/tests/test_arcade_routing.ts` — `test_game_loader_back_button_returns_clean_url` hardened with `vi.waitFor` (5s timeout, 20ms interval) instead of a bare `setTimeout(r, 0)`, removing the 1-in-8 timing race against the async `loadGame()` effect.

## Arcade Core System Hardening — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Extracted the Arcade shell (routing, selector, loader) from `ts/src/main.tsx` into a dedicated `ts/src/arcade/` module with a barrel export, matching the existing `hooks/`, `components/`, and `engine/` structure.
- Moved `getGameId`, `navigateTo`, and `navigateHome` to `ts/src/arcade/routing.ts` with no semantic drift for `navigateHome`.
- Fixed `navigateTo` so it preserves the current mount path (e.g., `/arcade/rfdgamestudio/`) when setting `?game={id}`, closing the same path-portability risk that `navigateHome` already handled.
- Moved `GameSelector` and `GameLoader` to `ts/src/arcade/GameSelector.tsx` and `ts/src/arcade/GameLoader.tsx`.
- Closed the registry-mismatch bug: `GameLoader` now calls `findGame()` after a successful `loadGame()` and shows a distinct error when a game exists on disk but is missing from `GAME_REGISTRY`.
- Removed the now-unused `findGameOrDefault()` from `ts/src/games/registry.ts`; no other callers existed.
- Replaced the `ts/tests/test_navigation.ts` file with `ts/tests/test_arcade_routing.ts`, extending it with the new Arcade tests.

### What was verified, not assumed
- A genuinely bad `?game=totally_fake_id` URL still fails correctly with the existing `Unknown game: ...` error from `loadGame()`. This path was already fine and was not touched.
- The registry-mismatch scenario was reproduced by temporarily removing `scrapcrawl` from `GAME_REGISTRY` while leaving its files on disk. `GameLoader` rendered the new distinct error: `Game "scrapcrawl" loaded successfully but has no registered config in registry.ts — this is a studio configuration error...`. The registry was restored immediately after the trace.

## ScrapCrawl Phase A.1 — Combat + Craft Gating Fix + UI Design Pass — CERTIFIED

### What changed
- Fixed a real bug discovered by playing: `resolve_fight` and the `Fight` button both lacked room-type validation, allowing free infinite wins at Home Base (no `difficulty` field → `difficulty` defaulted to `0`).
- Added a defensive backend guard in `logic.lua` that rejects fights in rooms without `fight` in their interaction types.
- Added a frontend gate in `App.tsx` that renders the `Fight` button as disabled in safe rooms.
- Fixed a second play-discovered bug: `craft`/`can_craft` took no room context, allowing crafting in any node. They now accept a `room` parameter and reject rooms without `craft` in their interaction types.
- Added a frontend craft-room gate in `App.tsx` that disables all craft buttons outside Home Base (the only craft-capable node) and shows a "No workbench detected" tooltip.
- Redesigned the ScrapCrawl UI to match the original `examples/scrapcrawl` identity: near-black canvas, equipment durability bars with threshold colour shift, proficiency bars, terminal-style combat trace, and crafting catalog cards.
- Rewrote `styles.css` using the shared token layer from `ui/tokens.css`; only deliberate hex override is the signature background `#07090d`, documented in-file.
- Added 3 Python and 2 TypeScript tests anchoring the fight gating fix, plus 3 Python and 2 TypeScript tests anchoring the craft gating fix.

### Hotfix (fengari numeric keys + Tool re-craft button + executor boolean bug)
- The TS runtime (`fengari-web`) passes JavaScript numbers as Lua floats (`1.0`) and YAML numeric keys as strings (`"1"`). `lookup_tier` in `logic.lua` now tries numeric, integer, and string forms so that `craft`, `can_craft`, and `resolve_fight` all work in the browser. A TS runtime regression test guards this.
- The Tier 2 craft button for the Tool recipe was incorrectly enabled after Tier 2 was unlocked (it looked affordable once the lock disappeared). Both Tool tier buttons are now disabled once the Tool has been crafted, matching the one-time-gate semantics in `logic.lua`.
- `executor.ts` was returning `true` for every pulled Lua boolean because `lua_toboolean` returns a JS boolean and `false !== 0` is `true`. It now returns the actual boolean value. Two executor tests guard this.
